      :type: bool

    .. attribute:: is_legitimate_proxy

      .. deprecated:: 2.2.0
        Due to the increased coverage by mobile carriers, very few
        satellite providers now serve multiple countries. As a result, the

    .. attribute:: static_ip_score

      An indicator of how static or dynamic an IP address is. The value ranges
      from 0 to 99.99 with higher values meaning a greater static association.
      For example, many IP addresses with a user_type of cellular have a
      lifetime under one. Static Cable/DSL IPs typically have a lifetime above
      thirty.
